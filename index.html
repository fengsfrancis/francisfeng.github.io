What is the license for the software?
•	matplotlib: The license is based on the Python Software Foundation (PSF) license (Matplotlib).
•	bqplot: The license is under the Apache 2.0 license(bqplot).
•	plotly: The license is under the MIT license(plotly).
•	R/Rstudio: R as a package is licensed under GPL-2 | GPL-3(Rstudio).


What is the focus of the software?
•	Matplotlib: Basically, it focuses on numerical mathematics extension NumPy for the Python programming language.
•	bqplot: It focuses on Graphics-based interactive plotting framework for the Jupyter notebook.
•	plotly: It focuses on the most commonly used platform to enable sharing of complex data and models for users to create with complex data.
•	R/Rstudio: R focuses on using free and open source to create software for data science or technical development.


Does it have interactivity, and how easy is it?
•	Matplotlib: It has interactivity. The matplotlib can import “matplotlib.pyplot” and call “pyplot.ion” for using an interactive shell
•	bqplot: It has interactivity. In bqplot, each attribute of the plot it the interactive widget that can allow users to integrate any plot with IPython widgets to create complicated features by using simple code
•	plotly: It has interactivity. Plotly's Python graphing library can provide online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools for users and makes interactive.
•	R/Rstudio: It has interactivity which it includes interactive components for users to execute


What are the pros and cons of using it?
•	Matplotlib: It supports various of data types of graphical representations that can be used in multiple python scripts. However, it wasn’t designed for exploratory data analysis and the library is in a low level 
•	bqplot: It can visualize a large amount of data but doesn’t have the interactivity at a point level that can visualize and see a particular plot or scenario.
•	plotly: Plotly Express can easily print plots from a single line of Python and create complex plots
•	R/Rstudio: it has great amount of libraries that provides user to do statistic, machine learning or data stuff.
